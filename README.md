# üèÉ Trunit

A Lightweight, Well-Documented Program to run your Terraria PC Server &amp; Python Discord Bot with Style!

## üåç How to add Trunit to your server

1 - First you'll need to make sure you have a server. You can see how to make one here: https://telegra.ph/Trunit-08-20

2 - Then just download the latest release of our program, drag and drop it into the
    folder of your server (where the server files are located), and you're done!
    Now whenever you want to start your server, just open the newly installed
    Trunit program!

3 - If you run into any problems just send us an Issue request on our Github page's "Issues"
    section and we'll try to help you out as fast as possible. This could mean you indirectly
    contributed to our program's code so It won't happen again to others, thank you!!

## üì∂ What is "Playit.gg"?

Playit.gg is a global proxy that allows anyone to host a videogame server without port forwarding by using tunneling, including Terraria. Only the server needs to run the program, not every player. Learn more at https://playit.gg

IMPORTANT! - Trunit is NOT associated with Playit, go support them!

## ‚ùì How it works

Trunit works by reading the files in the server's folder and opening the server files within the program as well as a python discord bot and playit proxy (not within the program), via user input commands. It is one of my goals to make the user interface as simple, clean and awesome as possible. I will personally then take notes of any issues you tell me about to improve the program. (as well as all my other projects)
